# Digital Sand Clock
Stunning sand sprinkling thant reacts on an angle (0-360). Follows real physic's laws of a gravity, friction. 
4 modes, which are rarity of e-sand
- normal
- more liquid
- more thick
- water (really fast moving like water)

2x 8x8 matrixes positioned diagonaly. Base is 3D printed. <br>

## Functionalities
- Angle reaction
- Set timer with buttons
- Beeping sound when timer ends
- (TODO) Set timer from app
- (TODO) Receive notification when timer ends
