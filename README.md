# Digital Sand Clock
**Stunning** sand sprinkling thant reacts on an angle (0-360). Follows real physic's laws of a gravity, friction. <br>
There are 4 modes, which are rarity of e-sand: normal; more liquid; more thick; water (really fast moving like water)

<br>

The device itself is 2x 8x8 matrixes (MAX7219 modules) positioned diagonaly. Everything except electronics and screws is 3D printed. 

Online simulation available <a href="https://exch.com.ua/e-sand_clock/e-sand_clock.html">here</a>
