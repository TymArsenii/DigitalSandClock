# Digital Sand Clock
**Stunning** sand sprinkling thant reacts on an angle (0-360). Follows real physic's laws of a gravity, friction. <br>
There are 4 modes, which are rarity of e-sand: normal; more liquid; more thick; water (really fast moving like water)

The device itself is 2x 8x8 matrixes (MAX7219 modules) positioned diagonaly. Everything except electronics and screws is 3D printed. 

<br> <br>
Online simulation is available <a href="https://exch.com.ua/e-sand_clock/e-sand_clock.html">here</a> (doesn't have delays to control the rarity on e-sand. Operates with max speed. In some cases may blink. In final device all the problems were fixed)

## Functionalities
- Angle reaction
- Realistic sprinkling
- **Amazing look :-)**
- (TODO) Set timer with buttons
- (TODO) Beeping sound when timer ends
- (TODO) Set timer from app
- (TODO) Receive notification when timer ends
