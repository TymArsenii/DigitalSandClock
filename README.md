# Digital Sand Clock
**Stunning** sand sprinkling that reacts on an angle (0-360). Follows real physic's laws of a gravity, friction. <br>
There are 3 modes, which are density of e-sand: normal; more liquid; water (really fast moving like water). They are changed automatically:
```cpp
uint16_t to_seconds=(minute*60)+second; //total timer's seconds 
if(to_seconds<=15) sand_type="water";
else if(to_seconds>15 && to_seconds<=40) sand_type="more_liquid";
else if(to_seconds>40) sand_type="normal";
```
<br>
For best accuracy hardware timer is used.

<br><br>
The device itself is 2x 8x8 matrixes (MAX7219 modules) positioned diagonaly. Enclosure is 3D printed.
<br><br>
## How to navigate menus
Slide the power switch to turn it on, you'll see the half of matrix filled, which means connecting to Wi-Fi.
If connected to Wi-Fi successfully, whole matrix will fill, which means winnecting to MQTT.
After all the success, you'll see last mode with all the settings working properly.

Click on both buttons - reset sand position (it will appear on top)

Settings:
- Timer's time (1)
- Brightness (2)
- Angle auto (3)
- Beep (4)
- AP/STA mode (5)
  
To enter settings "choose settings" menu - press any button. You'll see letter 's' and a number 1 or 2. 1 - timer's time; 2 - brightness... To enter setting, you chose, press both buttons.

Timer's time (1): minutes, seconds. You can change values with clicks or hold needed button to do it faster. If you do click-hold (fast) it will control directly minutes (without touching the seconds). Press both buttons to return to sand. 

Brightness (2): brightness value (1-16). You can change values with clicks or hold needed button to do it faster. Press both buttons to return to sand.

Angle auto (3): Automaticaly set angle, just to look good (On/Off). When enabled, hourglass will ignore real angle and generate a random one. Used to move an static position, to show it's posibilities and coolness.

Beep (4): Beeping sound, when timer ends (On/Off). When enabled, hourglass will beep, when all sand is in bottom position.

<!--AP/STA mode (5): Work as an access point or connect to Wi-Fi network (On/Off). When enabled, sand clock will open an access point. Connect to it, go to 192.168.6.9 and have the same control panel, as when connecting directly to Wi-Fi.-->
Mode (5): Select mode: 1 - sand timer; 2 - standby clock
  
<!--&nbsp; &nbsp; When in 5th setting press and hold any button to generate access point to enter your Wi-Fi credentials.-->

ðŸŸ¡ **Connection Info**  
> _While connecting to Wi-Fi at start half of matrix will be filled.  
> While connecting to MQTT whole matrix will be filled._  
>  
> If can't connect to MQTT server (whole matrix is filled for too long), possible to work in offline mode.  
> To enter offline mode â€“ press and hold one of buttons.  
> To try reconnecting again â€“ hold both buttons.
>
> To initially enter Wi-Fi credentials, hold any button at start (half of matrix will be filled), DigiSand control â€” Wi-Fi access point will apper. After connecting to AP, go to 192.168.6.9 and enter your Wi-Fi credentials.

## App
Control pannel is accessible on <a href="https://exch.com.ua">exch.com.ua</a>. 
1. Register first.
2. Go to DigiSand Clock Control.
3. Add device. Press settings icon next to device container label.
4. Save changes and go back to controls.
5. When device status is online, you can control you device with full capabilities.
<br> <br>
## Web
Online simulation is available <a href="https://exch.com.ua/e-sand_clock/e-sand_clock.html">here</a> (doesn't have delays to control the density of sand. Operates with max speed. In some cases may blink. In final device all the problems were fixed)

## Possibilities
- Angle reaction (0Â°â€“360Â°)
- Realistic sprinkling
- Adaptive sand density
- **Amazing look :-)**
- Set timer
- Variable brightness
- Angle auto mode
- Beeping sound when timer ends (optional)
- Saving all the settings to eeprom (power independent memory)
- Change any possible setting from web app and most of them from the device itself
- Set SSID, password (AP mode)
- Standby Clock (NTP server)
- Full online expirience

## Changelog
- v1.0 - Release
- v1.1 - Major improvements, fixes
- v1.2 - Full Wi-Fi capability, fixes
- v1.3 - New app expirience, standby clock, fixes
- v1.4 - App redesign, login, device manager systems. Local mode was removed. Better MQTT expirience
